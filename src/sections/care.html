<h3>Why you should care</h3>
<p>
  Css grids are like coffee shops. They're everywhere. They all do basically the same thing. But, there are only a few that you call home.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Molten.css</strong> is different. It's like that coffeeshop that finally gives you padded seats and an outlet at every table. But it's a coffeeshop
  that has only one beverage. No scones, no muffins, no lattes, only coffee.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Molten.css</strong> FINALLY gives you a quick way to create layouts for web applications. I mean, c'mon. Why hasn't this been done. Why does
  every css grid framework give you tools for websites. I mean, who even builds those anymore? But, seriously, layout those web apps quick-style.

<h3>What I'm not</h3>

<p>I'm not responsive (yet). I do not have buttons, tables, menus, froms, progress bars, etc. I have decided to modularize myself and perform one thing well, web applications. VERY WELL.</p>
